# Austen's Fast File Search

This is a highly efficient, multi-threaded file searching application that uses Python's built-in `tkinter` library for its user interface. The program quickly searches the specified directories for files containing the entered search text. It also allows the user to specify a specific file extension to narrow the search results. The user can view the searched files, found files, and manage search queries in a queue.
